        In such a time of need, I’ve felt called to demonstrate that code and software gives us
        power. I created a COVID-19 tracker for our home state of Massachusetts and I wanted to
        share it with you: https://ma-covid-19-tracker.launchacademy.com/

        Sure – technology can help to inform and to drive decisions, but the power of creation can
        be so liberating. While I was social distancing with my family (earnestly trying to channel
        my concern), after working intensely to serve our current students, I felt inspired to
        encourage others to discover this gift of creation.

        The truth is, there’s nothing special about this application. After studying with us, you
        could build this. In fact, many students that have come before you build capstone projects
        that are just like this app. So, I’ve open-sourced this application with one goal: to prove
        that you can take this adversity we’re all facing and channel it into a transformation that
        will change your life for the better.{" "}

        To demystify it, and to show how you can build something like it, let’s walk through the
        technologies that are at play.
      </p>
      <h3>Gatsby</h3>
      <p>
        Gatsby is a static site generator that works extremely well with the ReactJS front-end
        framework, a framework we teach during our 18 week course. We used it as the engine that
        drives the site. It effectively builds our web page and allows us to deploy it.
      </p>
      <h3>ReactJS</h3>
      <p>
        ReactJS powers sites like Facebook, and provides for rich front-end experiences. ReactJS
        applications are built with JavaScript, the front-end programming language of the web. It
        also allows you to write native applications for Android and iOS applications with React
        Native.{" "}
